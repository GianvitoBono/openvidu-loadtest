## **Browser Emulator documentation**

 Worker service implemented in NodeJS and controlled with a REST protocol that capable of connecting to an OpenVidu session and sending and receiving WebRTC media using openvidu-browser library.
The browser-emulator service provides several connection modes:

+ **Traditional mode**: It is able to start and launch **containerized Chrome browsers** using Docker and Selenium emulating a fully real user.
+ **Emulated mode**: It is capable to emulate a user connection without use a browser:

  + Overriding a WebRTC API using [node-webrtc library](https://github.com/node-webrtc/node-webrtc) and getting the media from a canvas publishing a moving image.
  + ~~Overriding a WebRTC API using [node-webrtc library](https://github.com/node-webrtc/node-webrtc) and getting the media from a **video file** using ffmpeg.~~
  + Overriding the peerConnection objects using [Kurento](https://www.kurento.org/) and getting the media from a video file.

This app provides a simple **REST API** that will be used by **Load Test application** and it allows:

* [Ping to instance](#ping-instance). Do ping to check if instance is ready.
* [Initialize instance](#initialize-instance). Initialize monitoring stuffs like ElasticSearch env variables and Metricbeat container. This request also set the AWS public and secret keys for uploading the **video recordings files to S3**, or Minio keys for uploading the **video recordings files to Minio** (just in case the test case includes recordings).
* [Create a participant](#create-participant) (`PUBLISHER` or `SUBSCRIBER`) **using a custom token** created by you or **creating a new token**.
* [Delete a specific participant](#delete-participant-by-connectionId) by its connectionId
* [Delete all participant](#delete-participants-by-role-publisher-or-subscriber) with a specific role (`PUBLISHER` or `SUBSCRIBER`).
* [Delete all participant](#delete-participants).

This services also is listening for a **WebSocket communication** on `ws:browser-emulator-addres:5001/events`. It will send information from openvidu-browser to the loadtest-controller.

## Running QoE Analysis

BrowserEmulator can run analysis on the Quality of Experience on your video and audio. For this, the following requisites have to be met:

- The `browserMode` when adding a participant has to be `REAL` (at the moment this option doesn't work with `EMULATED` users).
- AWS public and secret keys or Minio keys have to be set so the recorded video fragments can be uploaded to S3 or Minio.
- The original video and audio (separate files expected) need to be cut and concrete paddings added to them. This can be done with the *generate-mediafiles-qoe.sh* script. The mandatory options are:
  - -d: Duration of the cut video, the video will be cut from the beginning to the second passed in this argument.
  - -p: Duration of the padding to be added (in seconds)
  - -v: Video location URL, the script will try to download the video from this URL using wget.
  - -a: Audio location URL, the script will try to download the audio from this URL using wget.
  - -w: Video width.
  - -h: Video height.
  - -f: Video framerate.The video and audio have to be saved in `src/assets/mediafiles` in y4m and wav fromat respectively so browser-emulator can see them.
    - The video file has to have the following name: `fakevideo_[framerate]fps_[width]x[height].y4m`, for example: `fakevideo_30fps_640x480.y4m`.
    - The audio file has to have the following name: `fakeaudio.wav`.
      Alternatively you can use our already preprocessed videos that can be downloaded using the *download_mediafiles.sh* script. These have 1 secvond of padding and 5 seconds of cut video.

For the purpose of running the QoE Analysis, for each user pair 2 videos will be recorded during the run, one recording what the first user is receiving from the second and viceversa. These videos will be uploaded to S3 or Minio when [Delete all participant](#delete-participants) is run. These recordings will be called individual recordings.

When running [Initialize instance](#initialize-instance), you can add the property `"qoeAnalysis"` to the body, an object with the following options:
	- enabled: defaults `false`, setting this to true will enable the individual recordings.
	- fragment_duration: The duration of the cut video without the paddings chosen when running *generate-mediafiles-qoe.sh*
	- padding_duration: The duration of the padding chosen when running *generate-mediafiles-qoe.sh*

When [Delete all participant](#delete-participants) is run, all individual recorded videos will be uploaded to S3 with the following name structure: `QOE_[Session]_[UserFrom]_[UserTo].webm`, from here you have 2 options.

- Running the analysis in the same worker machine that recorded the videos, for that send a request to [Start QoE Analysis](#start-qoe-analysis)
- Running the analysis on another machine, for that pull this repository in that machine, cd to browser-emulator and follow the next steps:
  - Install all the needed dependencies on the machine, which are:
    - Python3 and pip3
    - [VMAF](https://github.com/Netflix/vmaf), set a VMAF_PATH environment variable with the path to the vmaf binary and move the `vmaf_v0.6.1.json` file found in the model directory to `/usr/local/share/vmaf/models/vmaf_v0.6.1.json`
    - [VQMT](https://github.com/Rolinh/VQMT), set a VQMT_PATH environment variable with the path to the vqmt binary
    - [PESQ](https://github.com/dennisguse/ITU-T_pesq), set a PESQ_PATH environment variable with the path to the pesq binary
    - [ViSQOL](https://github.com/google/visqol), set a VISQOL_PATH environment variable with the path to the directory that contains banzel-bin/visqol
    - [Tesseract OCR](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract), it is highly recommended to build it disabling multithreading as explained [here](https://tesseract-ocr.github.io/tessdoc/Compiling-%E2%80%93-GitInstallation.html#release-builds-for-mass-production) to improve performance.
      - You will probably need to save the necessary model found [here](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tessdata/raw/main/eng.traineddata) in `/usr/local/share/tessdata/eng.traineddata`
    - npm dependencies
      ```bash
      npm install
      ```
    - qoe script dependencies
      ```bash
      pip3 install -r qoe_scripts/requirements.txt
      ```
  - Save the individual recordings you want to analyze in `./recordings/qoe` directory.
  - Create a `qoe-results-processing-config.json` file (there is an example file with the same name in this repo), with the following structure:
    - elasticsearch_hostname: ELK hostname
    - elasticsearch_username: ELK username
    - elasticsearch_password: ELK password
    - index: ELK index to save the data
    - fragment_duration: The duration of the cut video without the paddings chosen when running *generate-mediafiles-qoe.sh*
    - padding_duration: The duration of the padding chosen when running *generate-mediafiles-qoe.sh*
    - width: Video width
    - height: Video height
    - framerate: Video framerate
    - presenter_video_file_location: Location of the original video, usually located in `src/assets/mediafiles/fakevideo_[framerate]fps_[width]x[height].y4m`
    - presenter_audio_file_location: Location of the original audio, usually located in `src/assets/mediafiles/fakeaudio.wav`
    - timestamps: Optional. An array of objects with info about when a user has been added to a session, used to make a timeline. If not added, this info will be searched in the index indicated in ELK. The objects have the following structure:
      - new_participant_id: username of the user
      - new_participant_session: session
      - @timestamp: timestamp when the user was added to the session (in ISO format)
  - Run:
    ```bash
    npm run qoe
    ```
  - You can also put a limit on the number of virtual cores used by the QoE scripts by adding the number as argument, for example with max 4 vcpus:
    ```bash
    npm run qoe -- --cpus=4
    ```
  - If you have the results of running the qoe scripts but have not uploaded them to ELK (*_cuts.json files) you can upload them by running:
    ```bash
    npm run qoe -- --process
    ```
  - If you don't want to automatically upload the data to ELK when a test finishes, use:
    ```bash
    npm run qoe -- --onlyfiles
    ```

After the analysis is done, the results will be uploaded to the selected index in ELK. A dashboard can be imported to Kibana importing the [loadtest.ndjson](load-test/src/main/resources/loadtest.ndjson) file. For more information about the imported data, check their respective pages: [VMAF](https://github.com/Netflix/vmaf), [VQMT](https://github.com/Rolinh/VQMT), [PESQ](https://github.com/dennisguse/ITU-T_pesq), [ViSQOL](https://github.com/google/visqol).
Note: The QoE results are normalized in the range 0-1 before importing them to ELK.

}
```

* #### RESPONSE

```json
Instance has been initialized
```

Note: the Minio variables (minioAccessKey, minioSecretAccessKey, minioHost, minioBucket) and the AWS variables (awsAccessKey, awsSecretAccessKey, s3BucketName) are exclusive, in the case the request has both types of variables the Minio ones have priority, and files will try to be uploaded to Minio.

`browserVideo` is only needed if using `browserMode REAL`. This object indicates what video to use, which will be downloaded. There are 3 types of video by default, having to be selected in the `videoType` property inside `browserVideo`. If using a default video type, the resolution and fps of the video to use have to be selected in the `videoInfo` property. All default videos have padding for possible usage in QoE Analysis. The default video types and available resolutions and framerates are the following:

- `bunny`: blender animated demo video
  - available resolutions and framerates:
    - Width: 640, height: 480, fps: 30
    - Width: 640, height: 480, fps: 60
    - Width: 1280, height: 720, fps: 30
    - Width: 1280, height: 720, fps: 60
    - Width: 1920, height: 1080, fps: 30
    - Width: 1920, height: 1080, fps: 60
- `interview`: interview video
  - available resolutions and framerates:
    - Width: 640, height: 480, fps: 30
- `game`: gameplay video with commentary
  - available resolutions and framerates:
    - Width: 640, height: 480, fps: 30

In Qoe Analysis object:

- fragment_duration indicates the duration of the video fragment between the paddings
- padding_duration indicates the duration of the padding

The default videos have been already processed by adding padding, the following durations are:

- `bunny`:
  - fragment_duration: 5
  - padding_duration: 1
- `interview`:
  - fragment_duration: 15
  - padding_duration: 1
- `game`:
  - fragment_duration: 30
  - padding_duration: 1

Also, custom videos can be used by providing an url, example of using a custom video (Note: it is highly recommended that the width and height of the videos are a multiple of 16 if using the QoE Analysis features):

```json
{
	...,
	"browserVideo": {
		"videoType": "custom",
    "customVideo": {
			"audioUrl": "https://fakeurl.com/fakeaudio.wav",
			"video": 
				{
					"url": "https://fakeurl.com/fakevideo480.y4m",
					"width": 640,
					"height": 480,
					"fps": 30
				}
		}
	}
}
```
